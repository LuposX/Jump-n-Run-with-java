# Jump'n Run.
This is a 2d jump'n Run Game. I programmed it with java and the libaries: slick2d and lwjgl.  
There are no textures in this game because the original textures had copyright on them.

# Building
If you want to build the game you need to include additional libaries:
- Slick 2d
- LWJGL

# Disclaimer
See License.
I dont maintain this project actively. This game is a project from when i was younger and is only on github due to nostalgia reasons and maybe if someone finds a code snippet helpful.
